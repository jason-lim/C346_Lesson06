# C346 Lesson 06 – React Native Sample App

This repository contains the starter and reference code for **C346 – Mobile App Development (Lesson 06)**. It demonstrates how to build a simple React Native app using reusable components, local image assets, and basic layout styling.

## What this app shows

- Structuring a React Native app with `App.js` and custom components in a `components/` folder
- Passing props into components to render different content
- Displaying local images from the `img/` and `assets/` folders
- Using basic layout and styling to present content cleanly

## Project structure

- `App.js` – Entry point of the app
- `components/` – Reusable UI components used by `App.js`
- `img/` & `assets/` – Local images and other static resources
- `app.json`, `index.js` – Expo / React Native configuration files
- `package.json` – Project dependencies and scripts
